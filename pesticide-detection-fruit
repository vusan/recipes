 Testing Fruits and Vegetables for Op Residues

Testing fruits and vegetables for organophosphates involves the following procedure:

    Cut the sample into small pieces;
    Place about 5 g in a test tube, add 5 mL of acetone and shake.
    Pour the acetone extract into another vial.
    Repeat steps 5 to 9 as in testing for residues in water.
